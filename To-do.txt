To-do List

- Make changing of the console state flags easier
- Make the interrupt handling system more coherent and 
	organized. (Shouldn't be in kernel.c right?)
- Implement a file system
	- Probably should start a disk and device abstraction layer
- Implement a shell
- Make scrolling more efficient by not clearing the entire
	screen but only that which must be cleared.
- Finish implementing useful keyboard keys
